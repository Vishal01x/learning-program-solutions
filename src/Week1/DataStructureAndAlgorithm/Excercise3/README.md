## Big O Notation is a mathematical representation of algorithm efficiency, describing how runtime or memory usage grows as input size increases. It helps:

- Compare algorithm performance

- Predict scalability

- Identify bottlenecks

- Make informed design decisions

## Search Operation Scenarios:

- Best Case: Minimum possible runtime (e.g., Ω(1) when item is first in linear search)

- Average Case: Expected performance over random inputs (e.g., Θ(n/2) for linear search)

- Worst Case: Maximum possible runtime (e.g., O(n) for linear search, O(log n) for binary search)

## Search Algorithm Analysis

### Time Complexity Comparison

| Algorithm       | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space Complexity |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| **Linear Search** | O(1)      | O(n)         | O(n)       | O(1)            |
| **Binary Search** | O(1)      | O(log n)     | O(log n)   | O(1)            |

### Algorithm Comparison

#### Linear Search
```diff
+ ✅ Works on unsorted data
+ ✅ Simple implementation
- ❌ Slow for large datasets (O(n))
- ❌ Inefficient for frequent searches
```
#### Binary Search
```diff
+ ✅ Extremely fast for large datasets (O(log n))
+ ✅ Efficient for frequent searches
- ❌ Requires sorted data (adds O(n log n) sorting overhead)
- ❌ Only works with random-access data structures
```
### Suitability for E-commerce Platform

- Linear Search:

    1. Simple to implement

    2. Works on unsorted data

    3. Not efficient for large datasets

- Binary Search:

    1. Very efficient (O(log n))

    2. Requires sorted data or pre-sorted index

    3. Suitable for large product databases
